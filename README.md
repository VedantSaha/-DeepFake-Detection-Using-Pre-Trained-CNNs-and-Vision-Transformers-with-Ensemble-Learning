# ðŸŽ­ DeepFake Detection Using Pre-Trained CNNs and Vision Transformers with Ensemble Learning

This repository contains the LaTeX source code and supplementary assets for a research project focused on detecting DeepFake images using a range of pre-trained deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The project investigates individual model performance, ensemble strategies, and architectural behaviors in data-limited scenarios.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

DeepFakes present a significant challenge to digital media authenticity. This study evaluates the effectiveness of pre-trained CNNs and ViTs on a subset of the **FaceForensics++** dataset for **binary classification** (real vs. fake facial images). Special emphasis is placed on:
- How each architecture handles **limited training data**
- Comparative performance across models
- Benefits of **ensemble learning** for boosting prediction stability

## ðŸ§  Key Models Explored

- **VGG16** â€” Traditional CNN baseline  
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** â€” Transformer-based image classification  
- **GenConViT** â€” Hybrid CNN-Transformer model  
- **DeepFake-Adapter** â€” Adapter-based fine-tuning for DeepFake detection
